# part2

-The program compiles and works as specified. 
-However does not check if the other programs work individually
-Nice structure and indentation
-Rename a couple of variables with a better name like ans could be counter, when counting the occurences of a character
-I am going to try to add a feature that supports for loops and if statements that donâ€™t have curly braces
-if the line has an if and a for in the line, then the amount of tabs should increase by one
-How do we know when the loop statement ends when there is no closed bracket and we no longer needs the tabs.
